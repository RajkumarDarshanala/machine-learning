In this project we will predict the profit for a compaies based on location(state), marketing spend, administration spend, R&D spend

based on all this data avaliable we make use of multiple linear regression model and train the model 

after the traing with the necessary traun set of the dataset set we had we use test set to test out model.
so based on predicted and test output we calculate the accuracy and error and the accuaracy is 96.76799636026987 %

Its great prediction :-)
