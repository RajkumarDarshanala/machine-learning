In this project we will predict the profit for a compaies based on location(state), marketing spend, administration spend, R&D spend of 50 start up companies data we have taken from super data science

based on all this data avaliable we make use of multiple linear regression model and train the model 

after the traing with the necessary traun set of the dataset set we had we use test set to test out model.
so based on predicted and test output we calculate the accuracy and error and the accuaracy is 96.76799636026987 %

Its great prediction :-)
 i also implimented using backward eliminatinn technique to consider only the statistically most important variable and prediction accuracy is about 96.67%
 may be less than previos prediction but great prediction which takes less independent variable as input.
