# machine-learning
machine learning model that were implemented on Spyder(python 3.7) .

here in this repository the models posted were perfectly implimented models in spyder and were very simple codes 

The list of the models are

Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression

Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification

Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat

Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling

Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP

Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks

Note itincludes only the python codes and the required datasets
